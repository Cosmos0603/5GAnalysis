Even till this date, almost two years later, its impact has not diminished. Our study aims to investigate the health, economic, and political impact of COVID-19 in various countries around the world, in addition to a comprehensive study on all states within the United States. This project draws data from COVID-19 Open Dataset, which contains aggregated data tables from sources such as Wikidata, DataCommons, Eurostat, WorldBank, WorldPop, LawAtlas Project, University of Oxford, Google LLC, and etc. We decided to use this dataset as it only aggregated data without cleaning or processing the data from the original sources, and it clearly indicates the sources and licences for all data points in every single table we use. Having these data, this project aims to investigate the following questions: How much is economy affected by the rise of COVID-19 in different countries? Has government interventions been effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19? Are regions with good health records more resistant to the COVID-19 spread? In the following chapters, we will discuss these questions and provide visualization and insights from our data.

From the above data source, we collected and used six datasets: Economic indicators by countries, Covid-19 cases records, government emergency declarations, health indicators by regions, movement of people, and population vaccination records. Furthermore, we used an index data table which contains references to id/keys from other tables. 2.1 Economic Indicators by countries Dataset: economy.csv The economy dataset is consisted of 365 rows with 4 columns, as described below. Each row corresponds to a country. This dataset mainly describes important ecocnomic indicators associated with each country. Schema Name Name Description Example key string Unique string identifying the region US gdp integer [USD] Gross domestic product; monetary value of all finished goods and services 24450604878 gdp_per_capita integer [USD] Gross domestic product divided by total population 1148 human_capital_index double [0-1] Mobilization of the economic and professional potential of citizens 0.765 Sources of data Show data sources Data Source License and Terms of Use Metadata Wikipedia Terms of Use Metadata Eurostat CC BY Economy Wikidata CC0 Economy DataCommons Attribution required Economy WorldBank CC BY 2.2 Covid-19 cases records Dataset: epidemiology.csv The epidemiology dataset is fairly large. It consists of 9517268 rows with 10 columns, as described below. This dataset is time-series, with dates associated with each country/region. The major information includes newly confirmed, deceased, tested number of individuals with COVID-19 as well as the cumulative amounts for each category. Schema Name Type Description Example date string ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the datapoint 2020-03-30 key string Unique string identifying the region CN_HB new_confirmed1 integer Count of new cases confirmed after positive test on this date 34 new_deceased1 integer Count of new deaths from a positive COVID-19 case on this date 2 new_recovered1 integer Count of new recoveries from a positive COVID-19 case on this date 13 new_tested2 integer Count of new COVID-19 tests performed on this date 13 cumulative_confirmed3 integer Cumulative sum of cases confirmed after positive test to date 6447 cumulative_deceased3 integer Cumulative sum of deaths from a positive COVID-19 case to date 133 cumulative_recovered3 integer Cumulative sum of recoveries from a positive COVID-19 case to date 133 cumulative_tested2,3 integer Cumulative sum of COVID-19 tests performed to date 133 1Values can be negative, typically indicating a correction or an adjustment in the way they were measured. For example, a case might have been incorrectly flagged as recovered one date so it will be subtracted from the following date. 2Some health authorities only report PCR testing. This variable usually refers to cumulative number of tests and not tested persons, but some health authorities only report tested persons. 3Cumulative count will not always amount to the sum of daily counts, because many authorities make changes to criteria for counting cases, but not always make adjustments to the data. There is also potential missing data. All of that makes the cumulative counts drift away from the sum of all daily counts over time, which is why the cumulative values, if reported, are kept in a separate column.

Detailed code can be access here: data transformation notebook 3.1 Epidemiology Table For the epidemiology data, the raw data is consist of both country level and US state level datapoints. So we divided it into two tables, one for global country level and the other for the US state level, and we keep only the most relevant columns. The preprocessing steps is as following: Filter column location_key. If it is a key corresponding to a country, we add the row into our country-level table; it it is a US state key, we add the row into our state-level table. Select columns: date, location_key, new_confirmed, new_deceased, cumulative_confirmed, cumulative_deceased After cleaning, the country-level table has 163609 rows and 6 columns while the state-level table has 38537 rows and 6 columns.

We extracted only the same set of countries as in other tables to keep consistency across tables. The resulting table has 203 rows and three columns. ## # A tibble: 202 x 3 ## location_key gdp_usd gdp_per_capita_usd ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 AD 3154057987 40886 ## 2 AE 421142267937 43103 ## 3 AF 19101353832 502 ## 4 AG 1727759259 17790 ## 5 AL 15278077446 5352 ## 6 AM 13672802157 4622 ## 7 AO 94635415869 2973 ## 8 AR 449663446954 10006 ## 9 AS 636000000 11466 ## 10 AT 455140042000 51448 ## # ... with 192 more rows Description of each column is as following (The country-level and the state-level table has the same structure): Column Description location_key The code corresponding to the country gdp_usd Gross domestic product of the country in US dollars gdp_per_capita_usd Gross domestic product of the country in US dollars divided by its total population 3.3 First Mitigation Date Table The raw data are a table recording the mitigation policies and emergency declarations status of each state in the US. We derive the date that the first mitigation policy is published in each state from the raw data and formulate a new table of 51 rows and 2 columns. ## # A tibble: 51 x 2 ## state_code first_mitigate_date ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 US_AK 2020-03-09 ## 2 US_AL 2020-03-13 ## 3 US_AR 2020-03-11 ## 4 US_AZ 2020-03-11 ## 5 US_CA 2020-03-04 ## 6 US_CO 2020-03-11 ## 7 US_CT 2020-03-10 ## 8 US_DC 2020-03-11 ## 9 US_DE 2020-03-13 ## 10 US_FL 2020-03-01 ## # ... with 41 more rows Description of each column is as following: Column Description state_code The code corresponding to the state (e.g. US_CA) first_mitigate_date the date that the first mitigation policy is published in the state 3.4 Health Table The raw data give several health indicators such as smoke prevalence in different regions. As country-level and state-level information are mixed together in the raw data, we need to separate them into two tables. Preprocessing steps: Filter column location_key. If it is a key corresponding to a country, we add the row into our country-level table; it it is a US state key, we add the row into our state-level table. As the state-level information only contains one health indicator, life_expectancy, and all other columns are all NAs. Country-level table: ## # A tibble: 210 x 14 ## location_key life_expectancy smoking_prevalence diabetes_prevalence ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 AD NA 33.5 7.7 ## 2 AE 77.8 28.9 16.3 ## 3 AF 64.5 NA 9.2 ## 4 AG 76.9 NA 13.1 ## 5 AL 78.9 28.7 9 ## 6 AM 74.9 24.1 6.1 ## 7 AO 60.8 NA 4.5 ## 8 AR 76.5 21.8 5.9 ## 9 AT 81.8 29.6 6.6 ## 10 AU 82.7 14.7 5.6 ## # ... with 200 more rows, and 10 more variables: infant_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # adult_male_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, adult_female_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pollution_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, comorbidity_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # hospital_beds_per_1000 &lt;dbl&gt;, nurses_per_1000 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # physicians_per_1000 &lt;dbl&gt;, health_expenditure_usd &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # out_of_pocket_health_expenditure_usd &lt;dbl&gt; State-level table: ## # A tibble: 53 x 2 ## location_key life_expectancy ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 US_AK 78 ## 2 US_AL 75.1 ## 3 US_AR 75.6 ## 4 US_AZ 78.7 ## 5 US_CA 80.8 ## 6 US_CO 80 ## 7 US_CT 80.4 ## 8 US_DE 77.8 ## 9 US_FL 78.9 ## 10 US_GA 77.2 ## # ... with 43 more rows 3.5 Mobility Table Only state-level information are available in the raw data. After cleaning the data and select only the valid state code, we generate a table of 33762 rows and 8 columns. Description of each column is as following: Column Description date The date of the data being recorded location_key The code corresponding to the country/state mobility_retail_and_recreation percentage change in visits to retail and recreation mobility_grocery_and_pharmacy percentage change in visits to grocery and pharmacy mobility_parks percentage change in visits to parks mobility_transit_stations percentage change in visits to transit stations mobility_workplaces percentage change in visits to workplaces mobility_residential percentage change in visits to residential areas 3.6 Vaccination Table The raw data of vaccination records also have country-level and state-level mixed together. So we separated them into two tables. Moreover, we found out that country-level records do no have information about vaccine of different providers (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen), so we remove these columns from the country-level table. ## # A tibble: 34,202 x 6 ## date location_key new_persons_vacc~ cumulative_perso~ new_persons_full~ ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2021-01-25 AD NA 576 NA ## 2 2021-02-01 AD 460 1036 NA ## 3 2021-02-10 AD 255 1291 NA ## 4 2021-02-12 AD 331 1622 NA ## 5 2021-02-19 AD 519 2141 NA ## 6 2021-02-24 AD 249 2390 NA ## 7 2021-02-26 AD 0 NA NA ## 8 2021-03-08 AD 49 2439 NA ## 9 2021-03-10 AD 1211 3650 92 ## 10 2021-03-15 AD 3448 7098 1 ## # ... with 34,192 more rows, and 1 more variable: ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated &lt;dbl&gt; ## # A tibble: 18,471 x 12 ## date location_key new_persons_vacc~ cumulative_perso~ new_persons_full~ ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2021-01-12 US_AK NA 22486 NA ## 2 2021-01-13 US_AK 2055 24541 766 ## 3 2021-01-14 US_AK 10967 35508 0 ## 4 2021-01-15 US_AK 4038 39546 3240 ## 5 2021-01-19 US_AK 15888 55434 1396 ## 6 2021-01-20 US_AK 1477 56911 481 ## 7 2021-01-21 US_AK 2538 59449 1069 ## 8 2021-01-22 US_AK 7813 67262 1366 ## 9 2021-01-23 US_AK 5752 73014 1488 ## 10 2021-01-24 US_AK 4911 77925 995 ## # ... with 18,461 more rows, and 7 more variables: ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # new_persons_fully_vaccinated_pfizer &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated_pfizer &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # new_persons_fully_vaccinated_moderna &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated_moderna &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # new_persons_fully_vaccinated_janssen &lt;dbl&gt;, ... "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Country-level Epidemiology Table 4.2 State-level Epidemiology Table", " Chapter 4 Missing values As the epidemiology table is our main focus, we perform a missing value analysis on both the country-level and state-level of this table. 4.1 Country-level Epidemiology Table Among the 163609 rows and 6 columns of the data, a total of 1290 values were missed in 5 columns which are location_key, new_deceased, cumulative_deceased, new_confirmed, cumulative_confirmed. Table 4.1: Missing values of Country-level Epidemiology Table column count location_key 708 new_deceased 203 cumulative_deceased 202 new_confirmed 89 cumulative_confirmed 88 From the missing pattern visualization, we notice that there are a total of 7 missing patterns (excluding complete cases) from over 160000 rows of data with 6 features. The plot in the middle shows all the missing patterns. The plot on the top shows the corresponding frequencies of each patterns while the plot on the right shows the corresponding frequencies of each variables. The majority (~80%) of the missing patterns lacks data in the location_key column, which makes these data invalid as location_key is the main id of our data. Without location_key, we are not able to know where the data is being recorded, and thus the data will be useless in our analysis. The rest of the missing patterns has very minimal occurrences and could be discarded for now in the analysis. 4.2 State-level Epidemiology Table Different from the country-level table, the state-level table is very clean. Among the 38537 rows and 6 columns of the data, a total of 9 values were missed in 2 columns which are cumulative_deceased, cumulative_confirmed. It is possible that the US government has put a great effort on keeping track of the epidemiology statistics. Moreover, as the missing values are all cumulative counts, we can infer these values from the counts of new cases.
