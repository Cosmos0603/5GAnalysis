Even till this date, almost two years later, its impact has not diminished. Our study aims to investigate the health, economic, and political impact of COVID-19 in various countries around the world, in addition to a comprehensive study on all states within the United States. This project draws data from COVID-19 Open Dataset, which contains aggregated data tables from sources such as Wikidata, DataCommons, Eurostat, WorldBank, WorldPop, LawAtlas Project, University of Oxford, Google LLC, and etc. We decided to use this dataset as it only aggregated data without cleaning or processing the data from the original sources, and it clearly indicates the sources and licences for all data points in every single table we use. Having these data, this project aims to investigate the following questions: How much is economy affected by the rise of COVID-19 in different countries? Has government interventions been effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19? Are regions with good health records more resistant to the COVID-19 spread? In the following chapters, we will discuss these questions and provide visualization and insights from our data.

For example, a case might have been incorrectly flagged as recovered one date so it will be subtracted from the following date. 2Some health authorities only report PCR testing. This variable usually refers to cumulative number of tests and not tested persons, but some health authorities only report tested persons. 3Cumulative count will not always amount to the sum of daily counts, because many authorities make changes to criteria for counting cases, but not always make adjustments to the data. There is also potential missing data. All of that makes the cumulative counts drift away from the sum of all daily counts over time, which is why the cumulative values, if reported, are kept in a separate column.

Detailed code can be access here: data transformation notebook 3.1 Epidemiology Table For the epidemiology data, the raw data is consist of both country level and US state level datapoints. So we divided it into two tables, one for global country level and the other for the US state level, and we keep only the most relevant columns. The preprocessing steps is as following: Filter column location_key. If it is a key corresponding to a country, we add the row into our country-level table; it it is a US state key, we add the row into our state-level table. Select columns: date, location_key, new_confirmed, new_deceased, cumulative_confirmed, cumulative_deceased After cleaning, the country-level table has 163609 rows and 6 columns while the state-level table has 38537 rows and 6 columns. Country-level table: ## # A tibble: 163,609 x 6 ## date location_key new_confirmed new_deceased cumulative_confirmed ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2020-01-01 AD 0 0 0 ## 2 2020-01-02 AD 0 0 0 ## 3 2020-01-03 AD 0 0 0 ## 4 2020-01-04 AD 0 0 0 ## 5 2020-01-05 AD 0 0 0 ## 6 2020-01-06 AD 0 0 0 ## 7 2020-01-07 AD 0 0 0 ## 8 2020-01-08 AD 0 0 0 ## 9 2020-01-09 AD 0 0 0 ## 10 2020-01-10 AD 0 0 0 ## # ... with 163,599 more rows, and 1 more variable: cumulative_deceased &lt;dbl&gt; State-level table: ## # A tibble: 38,537 x 6 ## date location_key new_confirmed new_deceased cumulative_confirmed ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2020-01-22 US_AK 0 0 0 ## 2 2020-01-23 US_AK 0 0 0 ## 3 2020-01-24 US_AK 0 0 0 ## 4 2020-01-25 US_AK 0 0 0 ## 5 2020-01-26 US_AK 0 0 0 ## 6 2020-01-27 US_AK 0 0 0 ## 7 2020-01-28 US_AK 0 0 0 ## 8 2020-01-29 US_AK 0 0 0 ## 9 2020-01-30 US_AK 0 0 0 ## 10 2020-01-31 US_AK 0 0 0 ## # ... with 38,527 more rows, and 1 more variable: cumulative_deceased &lt;dbl&gt; Description of each column is as following (The country-level and the state-level table has the same structure): Column Description date The date of the record location_key The code corresponding to the country/state new_confirmed # of new Covid confirmed cases of the date in the country/state new_deceased # of new Covid deceased cases of the date in the country/state cumulative_confirmed # of cumulative Covid confirmed cases of the date in the country/state cumulative_deceased # of cumulative Covid deceased cases of the date in the country/state 3.2 Economy Table The raw data of the economy table are country-level economic statistics. We extracted only the same set of countries as in other tables to keep consistency across tables. The resulting table has 203 rows and three columns. ## # A tibble: 202 x 3 ## location_key gdp_usd gdp_per_capita_usd ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 AD 3154057987 40886 ## 2 AE 421142267937 43103 ## 3 AF 19101353832 502 ## 4 AG 1727759259 17790 ## 5 AL 15278077446 5352 ## 6 AM 13672802157 4622 ## 7 AO 94635415869 2973 ## 8 AR 449663446954 10006 ## 9 AS 636000000 11466 ## 10 AT 455140042000 51448 ## # ... with 192 more rows Description of each column is as following (The country-level and the state-level table has the same structure): Column Description location_key The code corresponding to the country gdp_usd Gross domestic product of the country in US dollars gdp_per_capita_usd Gross domestic product of the country in US dollars divided by its total population 3.3 First Mitigation Date Table The raw data are a table recording the mitigation policies and emergency declarations status of each state in the US. We derive the date that the first mitigation policy is published in each state from the raw data and formulate a new table of 51 rows and 2 columns. ## # A tibble: 51 x 2 ## state_code first_mitigate_date ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 US_AK 2020-03-09 ## 2 US_AL 2020-03-13 ## 3 US_AR 2020-03-11 ## 4 US_AZ 2020-03-11 ## 5 US_CA 2020-03-04 ## 6 US_CO 2020-03-11 ## 7 US_CT 2020-03-10 ## 8 US_DC 2020-03-11 ## 9 US_DE 2020-03-13 ## 10 US_FL 2020-03-01 ## # ... with 41 more rows Description of each column is as following: Column Description state_code The code corresponding to the state (e.g. US_CA) first_mitigate_date the date that the first mitigation policy is published in the state 3.4 Health Table The raw data give several health indicators such as smoke prevalence in different regions. As country-level and state-level information are mixed together in the raw data, we need to separate them into two tables. Preprocessing steps: Filter column location_key. If it is a key corresponding to a country, we add the row into our country-level table; it it is a US state key, we add the row into our state-level table. As the state-level information only contains one health indicator, life_expectancy, and all other columns are all NAs. Country-level table: ## # A tibble: 210 x 14 ## location_key life_expectancy smoking_prevalence diabetes_prevalence ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 AD NA 33.5 7.7 ## 2 AE 77.8 28.9 16.3 ## 3 AF 64.5 NA 9.2 ## 4 AG 76.9 NA 13.1 ## 5 AL 78.9 28.7 9 ## 6 AM 74.9 24.1 6.1 ## 7 AO 60.8 NA 4.5 ## 8 AR 76.5 21.8 5.9 ## 9 AT 81.8 29.6 6.6 ## 10 AU 82.7 14.7 5.6 ## # ... with 200 more rows, and 10 more variables: infant_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # adult_male_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, adult_female_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pollution_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, comorbidity_mortality_rate &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # hospital_beds_per_1000 &lt;dbl&gt;, nurses_per_1000 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # physicians_per_1000 &lt;dbl&gt;, health_expenditure_usd &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # out_of_pocket_health_expenditure_usd &lt;dbl&gt; State-level table: ## # A tibble: 53 x 2 ## location_key life_expectancy ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 US_AK 78 ## 2 US_AL 75.1 ## 3 US_AR 75.6 ## 4 US_AZ 78.7 ## 5 US_CA 80.8 ## 6 US_CO 80 ## 7 US_CT 80.4 ## 8 US_DE 77.8 ## 9 US_FL 78.9 ## 10 US_GA 77.2 ## # ... with 43 more rows 3.5 Mobility Table Only state-level information are available in the raw data. After cleaning the data and select only the valid state code, we generate a table of 33762 rows and 8 columns. Description of each column is as following: Column Description date The date of the data being recorded location_key The code corresponding to the country/state mobility_retail_and_recreation percentage change in visits to retail and recreation mobility_grocery_and_pharmacy percentage change in visits to grocery and pharmacy mobility_parks percentage change in visits to parks mobility_transit_stations percentage change in visits to transit stations mobility_workplaces percentage change in visits to workplaces mobility_residential percentage change in visits to residential areas 3.6 Vaccination Table The raw data of vaccination records also have country-level and state-level mixed together. So we separated them into two tables. Moreover, we found out that country-level records do no have information about vaccine of different providers (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen), so we remove these columns from the country-level table. ## # A tibble: 34,202 x 6 ## date location_key new_persons_vacc~ cumulative_perso~ new_persons_full~ ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2021-01-25 AD NA 576 NA ## 2 2021-02-01 AD 460 1036 NA ## 3 2021-02-10 AD 255 1291 NA ## 4 2021-02-12 AD 331 1622 NA ## 5 2021-02-19 AD 519 2141 NA ## 6 2021-02-24 AD 249 2390 NA ## 7 2021-02-26 AD 0 NA NA ## 8 2021-03-08 AD 49 2439 NA ## 9 2021-03-10 AD 1211 3650 92 ## 10 2021-03-15 AD 3448 7098 1 ## # ... with 34,192 more rows, and 1 more variable: ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated &lt;dbl&gt; ## # A tibble: 18,471 x 12 ## date location_key new_persons_vacc~ cumulative_perso~ new_persons_full~ ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2021-01-12 US_AK NA 22486 NA ## 2 2021-01-13 US_AK 2055 24541 766 ## 3 2021-01-14 US_AK 10967 35508 0 ## 4 2021-01-15 US_AK 4038 39546 3240 ## 5 2021-01-19 US_AK 15888 55434 1396 ## 6 2021-01-20 US_AK 1477 56911 481 ## 7 2021-01-21 US_AK 2538 59449 1069 ## 8 2021-01-22 US_AK 7813 67262 1366 ## 9 2021-01-23 US_AK 5752 73014 1488 ## 10 2021-01-24 US_AK 4911 77925 995 ## # ... with 18,461 more rows, and 7 more variables: ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # new_persons_fully_vaccinated_pfizer &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated_pfizer &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # new_persons_fully_vaccinated_moderna &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated_moderna &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # new_persons_fully_vaccinated_janssen &lt;dbl&gt;, ... "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Missing Values Plot From the missing pattern visualization, we notice that there are a total of 7 missing patterns (including complete cases) from over 310 rows of data with 16 features. However, the majority (80%) of the missing patterns lacks data in the (age, gender, and highest level of education) categories. The rest of the missing patterns (except for the complete cases) has very minimal occurrences and could be discarded for now in the analysis. For this particular dataset (from a survey result), we have complete records in user opinion categories such as ‘5G awareness’, ‘5G Usage Experience’, ‘Chinese Collaboration’, various perspectives on 5G, as well as opinions on the influence placed by the Chinese government in the 5G industry. Having the above completed user opinion records, we can make correlation studies based on several intrinsic user features such as their countries, whether or not they are above 18 (inference for age), their operating system, and their cellular network. Overall, the dataset consists of adult users (&gt;18) mainly from the U.S. or India, we have limited differences in terms of the variety of users. However, we do have many combinations regarding their opinions in the 5G network and the relationship to the Chinese party. To complement the intrinsic user features (specific age, gender, and highest level of education), we would use additional data resources to inspect differences in opinions across age groups, gender, and education levels.
