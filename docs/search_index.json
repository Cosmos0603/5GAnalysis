Detailed code can be access here: data transformation notebook 3.1 Epidemiology Table For the epidemiology data, the raw data is consist of both country level and US state level datapoints. So we divided it into two tables, one for global country level and the other for the US state level, and we keep only the most relevant columns. The preprocessing steps is as following: * Filter column location_key. If it is a key corresponding to a country, we add the row into our country-level table; it it is a US state key, we add the row into our state-level table. * Select columns: date, location_key, new_confirmed, new_deceased, cumulative_confirmed, cumulative_deceased After cleaning, the country-level table has 163609 rows and 6 columns while the state-level table has 38537 rows and 6 columns. ## # A tibble: 163,609 x 6 ## date location_key new_confirmed new_deceased cumulative_confirmed ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2020-01-01 AD 0 0 0 ## 2 2020-01-02 AD 0 0 0 ## 3 2020-01-03 AD 0 0 0 ## 4 2020-01-04 AD 0 0 0 ## 5 2020-01-05 AD 0 0 0 ## 6 2020-01-06 AD 0 0 0 ## 7 2020-01-07 AD 0 0 0 ## 8 2020-01-08 AD 0 0 0 ## 9 2020-01-09 AD 0 0 0 ## 10 2020-01-10 AD 0 0 0 ## # ... with 163,599 more rows, and 1 more variable: cumulative_deceased &lt;dbl&gt; "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Missing Values Plot From the missing pattern visualization, we notice that there are a total of 7 missing patterns (including complete cases) from over 310 rows of data with 16 features. However, the majority (80%) of the missing patterns lacks data in the (age, gender, and highest level of education) categories. The rest of the missing patterns (except for the complete cases) has very minimal occurrences and could be discarded for now in the analysis. For this particular dataset (from a survey result), we have complete records in user opinion categories such as ‘5G awareness’, ‘5G Usage Experience’, ‘Chinese Collaboration’, various perspectives on 5G, as well as opinions on the influence placed by the Chinese government in the 5G industry. Having the above completed user opinion records, we can make correlation studies based on several intrinsic user features such as their countries, whether or not they are above 18 (inference for age), their operating system, and their cellular network. Overall, the dataset consists of adult users (&gt;18) mainly from the U.S. or India, we have limited differences in terms of the variety of users. However, we do have many combinations regarding their opinions in the 5G network and the relationship to the Chinese party. To complement the intrinsic user features (specific age, gender, and highest level of education), we would use additional data resources to inspect differences in opinions across age groups, gender, and education levels.
