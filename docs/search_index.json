Even till this date, almost two years later, its impact has not diminished. Our study aims to investigate the health, economic, and political impact of COVID-19 in various countries around the world, in addition to a comprehensive study on all states within the United States. This project draws data from COVID-19 Open Dataset, which contains aggregated data tables from sources such as Wikidata, DataCommons, Eurostat, WorldBank, WorldPop, LawAtlas Project, University of Oxford, Google LLC, and etc. We decided to use this dataset as it only aggregated data without cleaning or processing the data from the original sources, and it clearly indicates the sources and licences for all data points in every single table we use. Having these data, this project aims to investigate the following questions: How much is economy affected by the rise of COVID-19 in different countries? Has government interventions been effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19? Are regions with good health records more resistant to the COVID-19 spread? In the following chapters, we will discuss these questions and provide visualization and insights from our data.

From the above data source, we collected and used six datasets: Economic indicators by countries, Covid-19 cases records, government emergency declarations, health indicators by regions, movement of people, and population vaccination records. Furthermore, we used an index data table which contains references to id/keys from other tables. 2.1 Economic Indicators by countries Dataset: economy.csv The economy dataset is consisted of 365 rows with 4 columns, as described below. Each row corresponds to a country. This dataset mainly describes important ecocnomic indicators associated with each country. Schema Name Name Description Example key string Unique string identifying the region US gdp integer [USD] Gross domestic product; monetary value of all finished goods and services 24450604878 gdp_per_capita integer [USD] Gross domestic product divided by total population 1148 human_capital_index double [0-1] Mobilization of the economic and professional potential of citizens 0.765 Sources of data Show data sources Data Source License and Terms of Use Metadata Wikipedia Terms of Use Metadata Eurostat CC BY Economy Wikidata CC0 Economy DataCommons Attribution required Economy WorldBank CC BY 2.2 Covid-19 cases records Dataset: epidemiology.csv The epidemiology dataset is fairly large. It consists of 9517268 rows with 10 columns, as described below. This dataset is time-series, with dates associated with each country/region. The major information includes newly confirmed, deceased, tested number of individuals with COVID-19 as well as the cumulative amounts for each category. Schema Name Type Description Example date string ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the datapoint 2020-03-30 key string Unique string identifying the region CN_HB new_confirmed1 integer Count of new cases confirmed after positive test on this date 34 new_deceased1 integer Count of new deaths from a positive COVID-19 case on this date 2 new_recovered1 integer Count of new recoveries from a positive COVID-19 case on this date 13 new_tested2 integer Count of new COVID-19 tests performed on this date 13 cumulative_confirmed3 integer Cumulative sum of cases confirmed after positive test to date 6447 cumulative_deceased3 integer Cumulative sum of deaths from a positive COVID-19 case to date 133 cumulative_recovered3 integer Cumulative sum of recoveries from a positive COVID-19 case to date 133 cumulative_tested2,3 integer Cumulative sum of COVID-19 tests performed to date 133 1Values can be negative, typically indicating a correction or an adjustment in the way they were measured. For example, a case might have been incorrectly flagged as recovered one date so it will be subtracted from the following date. 2Some health authorities only report PCR testing. This variable usually refers to cumulative number of tests and not tested persons, but some health authorities only report tested persons. 3Cumulative count will not always amount to the sum of daily counts, because many authorities make changes to criteria for counting cases, but not always make adjustments to the data. There is also potential missing data. All of that makes the cumulative counts drift away from the sum of all daily counts over time, which is why the cumulative values, if reported, are kept in a separate column.

So we divided it into two tables, one for global country level and the other for the US state level, and we keep only the most relevant columns. The preprocessing steps is as following: * Filter column location_key. If it is a key corresponding to a country, we add the row into our country-level table; it it is a US state key, we add the row into our state-level table. * Select columns: date, location_key, new_confirmed, new_deceased, cumulative_confirmed, cumulative_deceased After cleaning, the country-level table has 163609 rows and 6 columns while the state-level table has 38537 rows and 6 columns. ## # A tibble: 163,609 × 6 ## date location_key new_confirmed new_deceased cumulative_confirmed ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2020-01-01 AD 0 0 0 ## 2 2020-01-02 AD 0 0 0 ## 3 2020-01-03 AD 0 0 0 ## 4 2020-01-04 AD 0 0 0 ## 5 2020-01-05 AD 0 0 0 ## 6 2020-01-06 AD 0 0 0 ## 7 2020-01-07 AD 0 0 0 ## 8 2020-01-08 AD 0 0 0 ## 9 2020-01-09 AD 0 0 0 ## 10 2020-01-10 AD 0 0 0 ## # … with 163,599 more rows, and 1 more variable: cumulative_deceased &lt;dbl&gt; "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Missing Values Plot From the missing pattern visualization, we notice that there are a total of 7 missing patterns (including complete cases) from over 310 rows of data with 16 features. However, the majority (80%) of the missing patterns lacks data in the (age, gender, and highest level of education) categories. The rest of the missing patterns (except for the complete cases) has very minimal occurrences and could be discarded for now in the analysis. For this particular dataset (from a survey result), we have complete records in user opinion categories such as ‘5G awareness’, ‘5G Usage Experience’, ‘Chinese Collaboration’, various perspectives on 5G, as well as opinions on the influence placed by the Chinese government in the 5G industry. Having the above completed user opinion records, we can make correlation studies based on several intrinsic user features such as their countries, whether or not they are above 18 (inference for age), their operating system, and their cellular network. Overall, the dataset consists of adult users (&gt;18) mainly from the U.S. or India, we have limited differences in terms of the variety of users. However, we do have many combinations regarding their opinions in the 5G network and the relationship to the Chinese party. To complement the intrinsic user features (specific age, gender, and highest level of education), we would use additional data resources to inspect differences in opinions across age groups, gender, and education levels.
